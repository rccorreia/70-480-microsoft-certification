# Certification 70-480

This material is compiled from numerous sources. Every Time I had doubts I went to google and then tried to write the explanation here, along with study cases.

Maybe there is some material needed for the certification that is not covered here, and for sure there is more than it is necessary for other topics. Sometimes I went for what I found interesting and not for whar was necessary.

I followed the appendix of [Skills measured](support-material/skills-measured.md), according to [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-480.aspx) on 2018-11-04:
