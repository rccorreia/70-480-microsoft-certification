# Definition

The HTML ```<footer>``` element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. It doesn't need to be only the footer of the main page, and not only one per page. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

The ```<footer>``` element is not sectioning content and therefore doesn't introduce a new section in the outline.

Examples:

Inside an article:
```
<article>
    <h1>How to be a wizard</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Grow a long, majestic beard.</li>
        <li>Wear a tall pointed hat. </li>
        <li>Have I mentioned the beard?</li>
    </ol>
    <footer>

    </footer>
</article>
```
