# Layout container in HTML

Your page presentation needs to be user friendly. HTML enables you to put all your content inside and ```<p>``` element and it's fine, but it isn't an nice user experience.

There is always the CSS option to layout your page, but here we want to know how to layout only using HTML.

The best way is using the new semantic elements. They provide semantic meaning for the tags while section and organize your content.

Thera are two most common methods for creating a layout in HTML:

* ```<div>```

  It divide the page into various styling purpose sections to create the layout. It allows for more dynamic capability in page layout.

* ```<table>```

  It is more appropriate for static layout. The ```<table>``` element is very flexible. Additional elements such as ```<thead>``` and ```<tfoot>``` provide a more semantic approach to labeling the table cells. The concern with using the ```<table>``` element approach is the static nature of the structure. To change the overall structure of a site that uses tables for layout, you need to go to every page and make the changes. Itâ€™s worth noting that some methods that make such changes easier have evolved over the years in response to the maintenance headache involved.
