# ```<article>```

# Purpose

Independent content such as a blog post or article.

# Definition

The HTML ```<article>``` element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry

A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an ```<article>``` element, possibly with one or more ```<section>```s within.

* Each ```<article>``` should be identified, typically by including a heading (```<h1>```-```<h6>``` or ```<hgroup>``` element) as a child of the ```<article>``` element.
* When an ```<article>``` element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be ```<article>``` elements nested in the ```<article>``` representing the blog post.
