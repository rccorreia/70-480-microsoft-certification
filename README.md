A repo for my study material, example code and important topics summary.

This repo was created on November of 2018, but the test is far older. Some content in this repo don't work like specified here anymore, but the topics here helps us to pass the exam. So please, if you want to learn the proper way to use HTML5, CSS3 and javascript, this isn't the best place or you should double check with another website like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) for every topic.
