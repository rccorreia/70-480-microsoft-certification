# Purpose

Content slightly related to primary content on page.

# Definition

The ```<aside>``` element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. For example, a sidebar, a note, an alert, or an advertisement.
The ```<aside>``` element doesnâ€™t place itself automatically to any particular side of the webpage; it merely serves as a way to semantically define a section of text or graphics as an aside.
