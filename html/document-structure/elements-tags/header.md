# ```<header>```

# Purpose

Introductory headings, could include navigation.

# Definition

The HTML ```<header>``` element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, a search form, an author name, and so on.
It is not limited to only the start of your page.
You can use the ```<header>``` element as a header to a ```<section>``` or ```<article>``` element. The ```<header>``` is intended to hold an H1â€“H6 element as needed; however, you can populate a header with any markup that suits your needs to create the best header for that particular area of the site.
