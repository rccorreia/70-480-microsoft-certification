# Implement html5 apis summary

* HTML5 introduced new semantic elements to more clearly define sections of an HTML page. These elements include ```<section>```, ```<article>```, ```<nav>```, ```<header>```, ```<footer>```, ```<aside>```, ```<progress>```, ```<mark>```, ```<figure>```, and ```<figcaption>```.
* Elements within an HTML page can have their layout controlled when they are included inside structures such as ```<div>``` elements and/or HTML tables.
* HTML5 semantic elements provide the mechanisms necessary to structure the page more easily for accessibility via screen readers.
* Search engines take advantage of HTML5 semantics by leveraging the ```<article>``` element to determine the purpose of the page.
