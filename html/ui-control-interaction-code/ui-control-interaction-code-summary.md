# UI control interaction code

* JavaScript is a powerful tool that enables developers to manipulate the DOM
programmatically in the browser.
* HTML5 supports rich media controls to incorporate video by using the ```<video>``` element and audio by using the ```<audio>``` element.
* The ```<video>``` element supports multiple media formats by using the ```<source>``` element.
* The HTML5 ```<canvas>``` and ```<svg>``` elements support a rich API to create both simple and complex graphics in the browser.
* Both the ```<canvas>``` and ```<svg>``` graphics engines can draw text, lines, shapes, fonts, fills, and gradients.
* The ```<canvas>``` element is drawn on via JavaScript by getting a reference to the context.
* The ```<svg>``` element renders graphics by using a declarative syntax.
