# Create a flexible content layout summary

- Flexbox allows you to lay out elements in a flow-like fashion.
- Multi-column layout allows you to separate content into a fixed number of columns, like a newspaper layout.
- The flow of text around elements like images can be controlled using wrap-flow layouts.
- The grid layout provides the best way to separate the layout from the content by specifying explicitly in CSS where each element should be displayed within a predefined grid.
