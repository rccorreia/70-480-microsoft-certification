# Changing the location of an element

By default, all HTML elements flow statically from left to right in the same order that they are declared in the HTML page. However, CSS provides a mechanism to specify some advanced options in element position. You can position elements by using absolute positioning or relative positioning.
With absolute positioning, the element is placed in the exact location specified, relative to its container’s borders. However, with relative positioning, the element is positioned relative to its immediate left sibling’s coordinates. You can apply four properties individually or in combination to control the position of an element: Top, Left, Right, and Bottom. Each property takes a distance parameter that specifies the relative distance of the object from a reference point based on the positioning attribute specified. When using absolute or relative positioning, the default border or margin settings are ignored because the object is positioned where
the positioning attributes direct the element to be.

[Here](examples/position.html) is the example page.
