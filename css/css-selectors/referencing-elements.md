# Referencing elements correctly

Elements can be referenced from CSS by their element name:

```
  div{…}
  section{…}
  p{…}
```

Or with the use of classes:

```
  .boldText{…}
  .largeWord{…}
```

Element names and classes can be combined to narrow the selector even further:

```
  p.largeWord{…}
```

You can use the id:

```
  #nameSomething{…}
```

you can group many elements and define the styles only once:

```
  p, H1, H2 {…}
```
