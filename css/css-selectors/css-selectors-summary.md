# Structure a CSS file by using CSS selectors summary

- Referencing elements correctly takes careful consideration of how you will structure your CSS and your HTML elements.
- Selectors can be nested and joined together to get more specific.
- HTML elements inherit styles automatically from their parent elements.
- CSS is processed from the top down, so that last style processed wins if it conflicts with other style declarations.
- !important can be used to ensure that the desired style is rendered when there is a competing CSS declaration.
