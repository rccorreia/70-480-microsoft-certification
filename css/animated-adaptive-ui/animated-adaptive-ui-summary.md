# Create an animated and adaptive UI summary

- HTML elements can be manipulated with transitions using the transition-property, transition-duration, and transition-delay CSS properties.
- Elements can be manipulated in 2-D and 3-D space with effects such as translate, scale, rotate, and matrix.
- Media queries allow you to have a dynamic, responsive user interface based on the view port size and type.
- The visibility property hides a control but keeps its position in the overall layout. Using the display property to hide a control removes it from the layout as well.
