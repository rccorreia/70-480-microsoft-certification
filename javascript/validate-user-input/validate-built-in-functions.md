# Validating data with built-in functions

The isNaN function provides a way to evaluate whether the value passed into it isnâ€™t a
number. If the expected form of data being evaluated is numeric, this function provides a defensive
way to determine this and handle it appropriately:

```
  if (isNan(value)) {
    //handle the non number value
  }
  else {
    //proceed with the number value
  }
```

The opposite of the isNaN function is the isFinite function.
