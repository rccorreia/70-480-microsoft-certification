# Create and implement objects and methods

*  Everything in JavaScript is an objectâ€”even functions.
*  JavaScript supports native objects and custom objects.
*  Objects are created with the new keyword.
*  Access methods and properties on objects with the dot notation: object.method or
object.property.
*  You can create custom objects dynamically or by using prototypes.
*  Prototypes provide for object definition reuse, whereas dynamic objects require
attributes and methods defined for each use.
*  Inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through the extension of prototypes.
