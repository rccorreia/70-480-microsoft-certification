# Consuming JSON and XML data by using web services

The two data formats commonly used in data transmission are JSON and XML. JSON is unstructured data, whereas XML is structured. 

JSON uses a special syntax that allows the definition of name value pairs in a lightweight string format. 

XML has named tags and opening and closing tags. Tags can have attributes. 


* JSON:
```
  {firstName: "Rick", lastName: "Delorme", hairColor: "brown", eyeColor: "brown" }
```

* XML (Elements):
```
  <Person>
  <firstName>Rick</firstName>
  <lastName>Delorme</lastName>
  <hairColor>Brown</hairColor>
  <eyeColor>Brown</eyeColor>
  </Person>
```

* XML (attributes):
```
  <Person firstname="Rick" lastName="Delorme" hairColor="Brown" eyeColor="Brown"/>
```

When publishing data services such as Web Services or a REST API, you can control how you publish the data.
