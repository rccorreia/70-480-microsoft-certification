## Review

Neither of these methods change the source array

- every method: returns true or false;
- some method: returns true or false;
- forEach method: doesn’t produce a return value;
- filter method: returns a new array containing the elements that are included based on a return value of true or false from the callback function;
- map method: creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array;
- reduce and reduceRight method: doesn't change the source array.
