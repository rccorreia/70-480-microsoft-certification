# Implement exception handling summary

* Structured error handling is provided by the JavaScript language in the form of the try…catch…finally block.
* The try…catch…finally block provides a way to try some logic, catch an error and handle it appropriately, and finally do some clean up.
* The finally block always runs whether or not an exception is thrown.
* Checking for a null value before accessing any objects to ensure that they are initialized is good practice.
