# Serialize, deserialize and transmit data summary

* Browsers provide native support via the JSON object to work with serializing and deserializing JSON strings.
* The JSON.parse method deserializes a JSON string into an object, and the JSON.stringify method serializes an object into a JSON string.
* By setting the XMLHttpRequest responseType property to the value 'blob', you can retrieve binary data.
* By default, the form submit action sends the entire page to the server (based on the action attribute) for processing.
* Handling the submit event allows you to customize how the form data is posted to the server.
* The jQuery.serialize method provides a convenient shortcut to convert specified input controls into a query string.
