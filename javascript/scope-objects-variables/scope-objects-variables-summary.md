# Establish the scope of objects and variables summary

* Variables are undefined until they are initialized.
* Variables are scoped and accessible depending on where they are declared. If they are
inside a function, for example, they are local to the function.
* Passing parameters is the only way to make a local variable available in another
function.
* The global namespace shouldn’t be used because it’s shared by all.
* You should apply a namespace to custom objects to prevent conflicts in the global
namespace.
* The this keyword provides direct access to the object that raised the event.
